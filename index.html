  <body>How a diesel generator is arranged
The device and principle of operation of the diesel generator are intuitive. It consists of:

- diesel engine;
electric generator;
electric panel
  As for the principle of operation of the station, it is based on the rotation of the rotor of the generator, driven by the shaft of the diesel engine, as a result of which the required level of electromotive force is created and current of the required frequency is generated.

At the same time, the efficiency of the power supply is largely determined by the uniformity of the rotation of the internal combustion engine shaft and the ability to neutralize significant differences in power consumption. That is, stable operation in automatic mode is required from the power plant. Therefore, the diesel generator is additionally equipped with:

mechanical or electronic engine speed regulator;
fine-cleaning air and fuel filters that allow you to prepare a high-quality combustible mixture;
fine oil filter;
In addition, the electrical circuit of the diesel generator includes various sensors that monitor the operation of the main components of the installation.


Types of diesel generators
The device and principle of operation of the diesel power plant are the same for all models. But they may differ in some technical features that determine their purpose and operating conditions. Yes, they can be classified by:

power, divided into low-power, up to 50 kilowatts, medium power, 50-200 kilowatts, and high-power, over 200 kilowatts;
type of cooling, with air and radiator cooling. At the same time, radiator cooling can be water-air, which involves cooling the cooling liquid with atmospheric air, and water-water, which involves the use of water from external sources;
destination The station can be lighting, power, able to cope with significant power drops, and special purpose, for backup use at nuclear power plants, in medical facilities and other emergency situations;
mobility Installations are produced for stationary placement, mobile and portable, which can be easily moved by hand;
of the method of generation of electromagnetic fields Power stations can be with a synchronous generator capable of working for a long time under power loads, asynchronous, simpler and more reliable;
number of phases. The installation of a diesel power plant can assume the presence of a single-phase output of 220 volts or provide three-phase generation, having outputs of 230 and 400 volts;
type of execution, which involves installation in a specially equipped room, with a protective cover, which allows the use of the installation on the street, or placement in a container, for the use of the station in a remote area on an open site.
Main results
The diesel generator, due to its reliability and endurance, can be used as the main source of electricity if there is no alternative. In addition, the efficiency of the diesel power plant is quite high, which allows us to talk about a very rational use of fuel.
